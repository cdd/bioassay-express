  D "A type of transcriptional regulation at the level of early termination. This process can occur only in prokaryotes, where transcription of an operon into messenger RNA and translation of that mRNA into polypeptides occur simultaneously. The general principle is that alternative mRNA secondary structures occur under different physiological conditions such as available amount of a particular amino acid. One set of conditions favors early termination of transcription. In the classic example of the trp biosynthesis operon, translation of the gene for a short, trp-containing polypeptide called the trp operon leader peptide pauses either at a trp codon (if tryptophan is scarce) or the stop codon (if trp is readily available). In the former situation transcription continues, but in the latter a Rho-independent terminator forms and reduces, or attenuates, expression of the tryptophan biosynthesis genes. Although the polypeptides encoded by leader peptide genes appear not to be stable once their translation is complete, it is suggested by recent studies that their nascent polypeptide chains interact specifically with ribosomes, specific uncharged tRNAs, or other cellular components to inhibit release at the stop codon and improve the function of transcriptional attenuation as a regulatory switch."

  D "Translational attenuation is a regulatory mechanism analogous to ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation. The system requires the presence of a short ORF, called a leader peptide, encoded in the mRNA upstream of the ribosome-binding site and start codon of the gene whose translation is to be regulated. Certain conditions, such as presence of the antibiotic tetracycline in bacteria or amino acid starvation, may cause slowing or stalling of the ribosome translating the leader peptide. The stalled ribosome masks a region of the mRNA and affects which of two alternative mRNA folded structures will form, therefore controlling whether or not a ribosome will bind and initiate translation of the downstream gene. Translational attenuation is analogous to ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation, in which mRNA remodeling caused by ribosome stalling regulates transcriptional termination rather than translational initiation."

Factor XII is a protein synthesized by the liver that circulates in an inactive form until it encounters collagen or basement membrane or activated platelets (as occurs at the site of endothelial injury). Factor XII then undergoes a conformational change (becoming factor XIIa), exposing an active serine center that can subsequently cleave protein substrates and activate a variety of mediator systems. Factor XII is a participant in the clotting cascade as well as the kinin cascade."
