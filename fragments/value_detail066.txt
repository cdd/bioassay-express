With this technique, both the binding interaction and bound compounds can be detected, which allows pools of 5-100 compounds to be tested for binding."

  D "Impedance biosensors measure the electrical opposition of an interface in AC steady state with constant DC bias conditions. This is accomplished by imposing a small sinusoidal voltage at a particular frequency and measuring the resulting current; the process can be repeated at different frequencies. The current-voltage ratio gives the impedance."

  D "Electrically active cells, such as neurons, muscle and endocrine cells undergo changes in membrane potential due to depolarization and hyperpolarization as a result of opening and closing of ion channels. The electrical recordings from these cells are obtained by the insertion or attaching microelectrodes to these cells. Patch clamp, voltage clamp and current clamp are three ways of studying the current-voltage relationships of these ion channels."
bao:BAO_0000060
  D "The current clamp technique is used to measure biological voltages such as the action potential of an excitable cell with a microelectrode while keeping electrical current through the recording electrode constant. It can be used for both extracellular and intracellular recordings."
bao:BAO_0000062
  D "The patch clamping technique is refined from the voltage clamp technique, wherein a blunt electrode is placed on the surface of the cell membrane. It is a common intracellular recording technique in electrophysiology that allows either the measurement of current passing through individual ion channels in cells or through whole cells. Suction is applied via the blunt electrode (glass pipette in classical patch clamp technique) to create a high resistance (gigaohm) between the electrode and cell surface. This seal isolates the ion channels within the patch from the rest of the membrane and allows the neurophysiologist to record only from these ion channels."
bao:BAO_0000063
  D "The voltage clamp technique is used to measure the ion currents across an excitable cell membrane, such as neuronal membrane, while holding the membrane voltage at a constant level. The neuronal membrane contains different kinds of ion channels including voltage gated ion channels. Manipulation of the membrane voltage using voltage clamping allows the current-voltage relationships of these ion channels to be studied."

  D "Bio-Layer Interferometry is a used for measuring biomolecular interactions. In this technique, the interference pattern of white light reflected from two surfaces: a layer of immobilized protein on the biosensor tip, and an internal reference layer are analyzed. Changes in the number of molecules bound to the biosensor tip cause a shift in the interference pattern, which can be measured in real-time."

  D "The optical grating coupler sensor responds to the change of optical refractive index of the liquid or gas cover medium and to the adsorption or binding of molecules on the surface. The optical grating coupler sensor chip is based on a fine optical grating prepared on a thin waveguide layer carried by a glass substrate. The optical grating couples the light of a He-Ne laser at a given resonance angle into the waveguide layer. This incoupling angle is very sensitive to the presence of adsorbed molecules and to any change of refractive index of the medium covering the surface of the chip. By precise measurement of the incoupling angle, the amount of the adsorbed material can be determined with ultra high sensitivity."
bao:BAO_0000069
  D "Cells are directly cultured onto the surface of a resonant waveguide grating (RWG) biosensor. The mass redistribution within the bottom portion of cells, mediated by stimulus is directly measured with the biosensor. RWG biosensor utilizes an optical beam with an appropriate angular content to illuminate a waveguide film in which a grating structure is embedded. When this beam is reflected by the sensor surface, the resonant angle dominates in the output beam. The mass redistribution within the sensing volume alters the incident angle. Because of its ability for multiparameter measurements, the biosensor has potential to provide high information content for cell sensing. These parameters include the angular shift (one of the most common outputs), the intensity, the peak width at half-maximum (PWHM), and area of the resonant peaks."

Binding of small molecule compounds changes the refractive index of the immobilized target, which can be detected by optical sensing. Shift in wavelength of light is proportional to mass changes near the sensor surface, with sensitivity to detect mass change being ~300 Da."

A scintillation counter is used to measure ionizing radiation. The scintillation counter consists of a sensor, called a scintillator, made of transparent crystal or an organic liquid that fluoresces when struck by ionizing radiation. A photomultiplier is then used to measure the light emitted by the sensor and is attached to an electronic apparatus that amplifies and quantifies the radiation signal."

The reaction mixture containing the receptor and radioligand is transferred to a filter plate, washed to remove the unbound radioligand. The bound complex remains on the filter, which can be eluted into the scintillation fluid and the radioactivity measured. Filter assays differ from SPA because a separation of free radioligand and radioligand bound to the receptor is required for measurement."
bao:BAO_0000408
  D "This assay is performed to study interaction between a radio-labeled ligand and the receptor in presence of cold ligand. The cells exposed to the radioligand and cold ligand are washed to remove the unbound ligands. They are then lysed and the bound radioactivity is counted in a liquid scintillation counter."
bao:BAO_0000017
  D "Scintillation proximity assay (SPA) eliminates the separation step of unbound radioisotopes and is performed using low energy radioisotopes (3H and 125I) as labels, which have short range electron emission. SPA involves the use of microscopic beads which are first coated with a receptor protein of interest and contain a scintillant. When stimulated by the binding of radio-labeled ligand molecules, they emit light, which is detected by the photomultiplier tube. SPA is suitable for high throughput since the protocol has no wash or separation steps."

  D "The role played by the reading obtained from wells to which the sample or one of the reagents was not added. This is subtracted from all the experimental readings prior to further analysis."

  D "The role played by the substrate, which is titrated without inhibitor to reflect the maximum enzyme activity at each substrate concentration."

  D "The role played by the substrate, which is titrated without enzyme and without inhibitor. The low controls should reflect the signal expected for no enzyme activity at each substrate concentration. Depending on the composition of the inhibitor stocks, DMSO might be needed in the control wells to assure consistency across all the experiments."

  D "It is the role played by the solvent (e.g. DMSO) in which the perturbagen was dissolved. The negative control is used to determine the base-line to compare the effect of the test perturbagen."
bao:BAO_0000080
  D "The role of a chemical compound or reagent used in each plate of an assay to normalize the response of the test perturbagens (by plate). Compounds that can have a positive control role are known from previous experiments or is a previously established standard.  It is usually highly active resulting in a strong response of the intended effect.  In an inhibition assay the positive control would usually result in the complete inhibition, which is then used for normalization (i.e. set as 100%). In an activation assay it would be activator used to normalize activity. Using controls provides an external reference and reduces the number of false negatives and false positives."
