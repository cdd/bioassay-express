  D "A nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p105 subunit isoform 2 phosphorylated form in which the phosphorylation occurs by the action of GSK-3 beta which forms an in vivo complex with and specifically phosphorylates nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p105 subunit at two Ser residues in the C-terminal region contiguos to the Death domain. Phosphorylation by GSK-3 stabilizes the protein. Example: UniProtKB:P19838-1, Ser-903/Ser-907, MOD:00046."

Phosphorylation occurs after the stimulation of cells with proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-1.
