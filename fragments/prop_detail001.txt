  D "A biosafety level is the level of biocontainment required to isolate hazardous biological agents in an enclosed facility. The levels of containment range from the lowest biosafety level of 1 to the highest at level 4.\n\nThe levels are as follows:\n\nBSL1:\n Suitable for work involving well-characterized agents not known to consistently cause disease in immunocompetent adult humans, and present minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment (definition from CDC).\n\nBSL2:\nSuitable for work involving agents that pose moderate hazards to personnel and the environment. It differs from BSL-1 in that 1) laboratory personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic agents and are supervised by scientists competent in handling infectious agents and associated procedures; 2) access to the laboratory is restricted when work is being conducted; and 3) all procedures in  which infectious aerosols or splashes may be created are conducted in BSCs or other physical containment equipment (definition from CDC).\n\nBSL3:\nSuitable for clinical, diagnostic, teaching, research, or production facilities where work is performed with indigenous or exotic agents that may cause serious or potentially lethal disease through inhalation route exposure. Laboratory personnel must receive specific training in handling pathogenic and potentially lethal agents, and must be supervised by scientists competent in handling infectious agents and associated procedures. All procedures involving the manipulation of infectious materials must be conducted within BSCs, other physical containment devices, or by personnel wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (definition from CDC).\n\nBSL4:"
