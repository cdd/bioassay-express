  D "A protein with a core domain composition consisting of an N-terminal K50 class Homeobox domain (Pfam:PF00046) and a C-terminal OAR domain (Pfam:PF03826). The homeobox domain consists of a self-folding, stable protein domain of 60 amino acids in which position 50 can confer a distinct DNA binding specificity. The K50 class of homeodomains recognizes a consensus DNA sequence of TAATCC. Homeodomain-containing proteins are known to play important roles in such diverse activities as embryonic pattern formation, cell-type specification, and differentiation."
