  D "A ribonucleoprotein particle of 325 kDa composed of a 7S (300 nucleotide) RNA molecule and a complex of six different polypeptides. This binds both to the N-terminal signal peptide for proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum as they emerge from the large ribosomal subunit and also to the ribosome. This binding arrests further translation thereby preventing the proteins from being released into the cytosol. The SRP-ribosome complex then diffuses to the endoplasmic reticulum where it is bound to the signal recognition particle receptor, which allows resumption of protein synthesis and facilitates the passage of the growing polypeptide chain through the translocon. Through a process involving GTP hydrolysis, the SRP-SRP receptor complex dissociates and SRP returns to the cytosol. Of the six polypeptides of SRP the 54 kDa subunit (SRP54) is the central player. It contains an N-terminal GTPase domain and a C-terminal domain that binds directly to the signal peptide and the SRP RNA. Examples of this component are found in Mus musculus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana."

The FACT complex has been shown to destablilize the interaction between the H2A/H2B dimer and the H3/H4 tetramer of the nucleosome, thus reorganizing the structure of the nucleosome. In this way, the FACT complex may play a role in DNA replication and other processes that traverse the chromatin, as well as in transcription elongation. FACT is composed of two proteins that are evolutionarily conserved in all eukaryotes and homologous to mammalian Spt16 and SSRP1. In metazoans, the SSRP1 homolog contains an HMG domain; however in fungi and protists, it does not. For example, in S. cerevisiae the Pob3 protein is homologous to SSRP1, but lacks the HMG chromatin binding domain. Instead, the yFACT complex of Spt16p and Pob3p, binds to nucleosomes where multiple copies of the HMG-domain containing protein Nhp6p have already bound, but Nhp6p does not form a stable complex with the Spt16p/Pob3p heterodimer."

Within NarGHI, electrons are passed from the two heme molecules in the NarI subunit down a Fe-S cluster chain in the NarH and NarG subunits to the Molybdenum cofactor, Mo-bisMGD, in the NarG subunit."

  D "A multimeric complex which consists of flavoprotein (subunit A ; InterPro:IPR003952), iron-sulfur protein (subunit B) and membrane-bound cytochrome b560 (subunit C; InterPro:IPR000701). In some Archaea, the membrane-bound subunits (C or C and D) do not necessarily contain heme. Membrane-bound subunits can bind or react with quinones."
obo:GO_0045284
  D "A membrane-bound flavoenzyme complex consisting of four subunits, A, B, C, and D. A and B comprise the membrane-extrinsic catalytic domain and C (InterPro:IPR003510; InterPro:IPR00224) and D (InterPro:IPR003418) link the catalytic centers to the electron-transport chain. In some species, the complex has only three subunits, and in these cases, there is only one membrane anchor instead of two. This family consists of the 13 kDa hydrophobic subunit D. This component may be required to anchor the catalytic components of the fumarate reductase complex to the cytoplasmic membrane. Fumarate reductase couples the reduction of fumarate to succinate to the oxidation of quinol to quinone, in a reaction opposite to that catalyzed by the related complex II of the respiratory chain (succinate dehydrogenase-(ubiquinone)). Examples of this component are found in bacterial species."

  D "A subcomplex of the respiratory chain located in the plasma membrane. It contains about 25 different polypeptide subunits, including NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), flavin mononucleotide and several different iron-sulfur clusters containing non-heme iron.
