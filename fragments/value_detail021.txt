  D "HCN2 is a member of the hyperpolarization-activated ion channel family, which shows selectivity for potassium over sodium ions. Channel gating is facilitated by cAMP binding to the cyclic nucleotide binding domain. HCN2 is the dominant form of HCN expressed in the heart, together with HCN4 (O70507). HCN2 shows significant expression in various regions of the heart, especially the ventricles.

A 14-3-3 protein is any of a large family of approximately 30kDa acidic proteins which exist primarily as homo- and heterodimers within all eukaryotic cells, and have been implicated in the modulation of distinct biological processes by binding to specific phosphorylated sites on diverse target proteins, thereby forcing conformational changes or influencing interactions between their targets and other molecules. Each 14-3-3 protein sequence can be roughly divided into three sections: a divergent amino terminus, the conserved core region and a divergent carboxyl terminus.
