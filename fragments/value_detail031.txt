  D "A CatSper channel protein that is a translation product of the human CATSPER3 gene or a 1:1 ortholog thereof. In mammals, four CatSper ion channel subunit genes (CatSpers 1-4) are required for sperm cell hyperactivation and male fertility. The four proteins assemble (presumably as a tetramer) to form a sperm-specific, alkalinization-activated Ca(2+)-selective channel. CatSper channels seem to require auxiliary subunits, such as CatSperB (PR:000000672). In common with other channels, CatSper3 proteins have an architecture consisting of six transmembrane domains (S1-S6), arranged in a voltage sensor (S1-S4) and pore modules (S5-P-S6), and with both N and C termini on the intracellular side of the membrane."

The carboxy-terminal region contains the Cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (Pfam:PF00027) (CNBD) and a region connecting the CNBD to the S6 segment (C-linker), which is important for modulation by transition metals. In addition, CNG alpha has a carboxy-terminal leucine zipper that seems to be involved in inter-subunit interaction. CNG alpha subunits combine with the beta subunits to form the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, which mediate sensory transduction in photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons. These channels are likely composed of four subunits around a centrally located ion-permeable pore that opens in response to the direct binding of intracellular cyclic nucleotides. CNG channels are non-selective cation channels. They are not gated by membrane voltage although their structure includes the transmembrane S4 motif known to function as the membrane voltage sensor in all voltage-gated ion channels, but it has been shown to be important for proper folding and processing. Alpha and beta subunits of the CNG channel are very similar, however only alpha subunits are able to homooligomerize and form functional channels."

The N terminus has a conserved domain that is also present in other voltage-gated potassium and sodium channels. The carboxyl-terminal region contains the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD). In addition, there is a structural element called the C-linker, the region connecting the CNBD to the S6 segment, which couples conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain to channel activation. Subunits combine to form the HCN channels. In common with CNG channels, HCN are cation channels that are modulated by cyclic nucleotide binding. Unlike CNG channels, HCN channels are voltage-gated, and are weakly selective for potassium. In contrast to most other voltage-gated channels, HCN channels open upon hyperpolarization and close at positive potential. HCN channels act as a pacemaker by regulating neuronal and cardiac firing rate, but also function as a regulator of membrane resting potential and resistance."

They are subunits of the small conductance calcium-activated channels. SK channels are independent of voltage and gated solely by intracellular calcium. These membrane channels are heteromeric complexes that comprise pore-forming alpha-subunits and the calcium-binding protein calmodulin. Calmodulin binds to the SK channel through the Calmodulin binding domain (Pfam:PF02888), which is located in an intracellular region of the alpha-subunit immediately carboxy-terminal to the pore. Channel opening is triggered when calcium binds the EF hands in the N-lobe of calmodulin. These channels play a crucial role in hyperpolarizing the membrane potential of excitable and nonexcitable cells."

In common with other voltage-gated channels, has a domain composition consisting of six transmembrane domains (S1-S6), arranged in a voltage sensor (S1-S4) and pore modules (S5-P-S6), and with both N and C termini on the intracellular side of the membrane. The charged S4 segment with a basic amino acid at every third position confers their voltage sensitivity.

The charged S4 segment with a basic amino acid at every third position confers their voltage sensitivity. A hallmark of this class is the presence of an N-terminal K+ channel tetramerisation domain (Pfam:PF02214) (T1), which encodes molecular determinants for subfamily-specific assembly of alpha-subunits into functional tetrameric channels. Carbonyl oxygen atoms from the potassium channel signature sequence (TTxGYGD) line the selectivity filter, where they preferentially coordinate potassium. Voltage-gated potassium channels are composed of tetramers of alpha subunits with each alpha subunit containing a voltage sensor and contributing to the central pore. This pore is formed by these subunits that encircle a central ion conduction pathway."

  D "A voltage-gated potassium channel protein that has amino- and carboxyl-terminal intracellular domains separated by a domain (common with other ion channels) containing six transmembrane helices (S1-S6) in which the last two helices (S5 and S6) flank a loop, called the pore loop, which determines ion selectivity. Unique to this class is the presence of an N-terminal PAS fold domain (Pfam:PF00989). In addition, in the cytoplasmic region downstream from S6, there is a segment that shares substantial similarity to the Cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (Pfam:PF00027) (CNBD) present in cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel subunits (PR:000000674 and PR:000000674). These channels regulate membrane excitability."

  D "A voltage-gated potassium channel protein that has a core domain composition consisting of six transmembrane domains (S1-S6), arranged in a voltage sensor (S1-S4) and pore modules (S5-P-S6), and with both N and C termini on the intracellular side of the membrane. The charged S4 segment with a basic amino acid at every third position confers their voltage sensitivity. Unlike other voltage-gated potassium channels, these proteins lack the N-terminal tetramerization domain (T1), which encodes molecular determinants for subfamily-specific assembly of alpha-subunits into functional tetrameric channels. Also, unique to this class is the presence of a carboxyl-terminal domain called the KCNQ voltage-gated potassium channel domain (Pfam:PF03520) or A-domain. Voltage-gated potassium channels are composed of tetramers of alpha subunits, with each alpha subunit containing a voltage sensor and contributing to the central pore. This pore is formed by these subunits that encircle a central ion conduction pathway. KQT channels are responsible for M-type potassium currents in the nervous and auditory systems and slow delayed rectifier K+ currents in the heart."

From these, there are two main classes, one containing exon 16 in-frame, and others with an alternative splice junction in exon 14 that results in a frameshift and early termination. In addition, exons 12 and 13 have alternative splice junctions, and exons 8,11, and 15a are subject to splicing. Many members of this class can form heteromeric channels with members of the class KCNQ3 (PR:000000730).

  D "A transient receptor potential channel protein that is a member of the subfamily V of the transient receptor potential cation channels (TRPs), with amino- and carboxyl-terminal intracellular domains separated by a domain (common with other ion channels) containing six transmembrane helices (S1-S6) in which the last two helices (S5 and S6) flank a loop, called the pore loop, which determines ion selectivity. The amino-terminal domain contains up to 6 copies of detectable ankyrin repeat (Pfam:PF00023). Most TRPs are relatively non-selective. They may be modulated by voltage changes but channel gating is generally effected by other means."

  D "A class 2 cytokine, IL-10 type that is a translation product of the human IL10 gene or a 1:1 ortholog thereof. Active interleukin-10 inhibits the synthesis of a number of cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-3, TNF and GM-CSF produced by activated macrophages and by helper T cells. Structurally, IL-10 is a protein of about 160 amino acids that contains four conserved cysteines involved in disulfide bonds."
