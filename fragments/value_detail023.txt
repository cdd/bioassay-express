  D "The endpoint is a quantitive or qualitative interpretable standardized representation of a perturbation (a change from a defined reference state of a \"closed\" model system) that is measured by the bioassay.  An endpoint consists of a series of data points, one for each perturbing agent (screened entity) tested the assay."

  D "Endpoint action correlation describes weather a low or high endpoint value corresponds to low or high activity. Specifically if the endpoint value is positively or inversely correlated with the action that corresponds to the endpoint and which is specified as 'mode of action'.

The second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PIP(3)], product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, acts largely through its role as a kinase activator.
