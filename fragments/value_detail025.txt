This complex is composed of four subunits, IKKalpha, IKKbeta, ELK, and NEMO. IKKbeta and NEMO subunits are known to be essential for activating NF-kappaB. Activation of NF-kappaB dimers is the result of IKK-mediated, phosphorylation-induced degradation of the IkappaB inhibitor, which enables the NF-kappaB dimers to enter the nucleus and activate specific target gene expression."

This complex is composed of four subunits, IKKalpha, IKKbeta, ELK, and NEMO. IKKbeta and NEMO subunits are known to be essential for activating NF-kappaB. Activation of NF-kappaB dimers is the result of IKK-mediated, phosphorylation-induced degradation of the IkappaB inhibitor, which enables the NF-kappaB dimers to enter the nucleus and activate specific target gene expression."
