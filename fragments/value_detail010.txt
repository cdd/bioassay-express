The posterior lateral line system consists of small sensory patches (neuromasts) located superficially on the skin or just under the skin in fluid-filled canals on the head of all fishes and most amphibians. The neuromasts are innervated by several lateral line nerves, which project primarily to the hindbrain. The posterior mechanosensory lateral line system is stimulated by local water displacements and vibrations, and detects propulsion of the fish through the water, as well as facilitating shoaling, prey capture, and predator and obstacle avoidance."

  D "The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the embryo sac over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The process begins with the meiosis of the megasporocyte to form four haploid megaspores. Three of the megaspores disintegrate, and the fourth undergoes mitosis giving rise to a binucleate syncytial embryo sac. The two haploid nuclei migrate to the opposite poles of the embryo sac and then undergo two rounds of mitosis generating four haploid nuclei at each pole. One nucleus from each set of four migrates to the center of the cell. Cellularization occurs, resulting in an eight-nucleate seven-celled structure. This structure contains two synergid cells and an egg cell at the micropylar end, and three antipodal cells at the other end. A binucleate endosperm mother cell is formed at the center. The two polar nuclei fuse resulting in a mononucleate diploid endosperm mother cell. The three antipodal cells degenerate."

  D "An adrenergic receptor signaling pathway that contributes to a reduction in cardiac muscle contraction. Beta-adrenergic receptor-induced cardiac relaxation is achieved by a GPCR-activated adenylate cyclase generating cAMP; cAMP then activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane protein PLB. In its non-phosphorylated state, PLB acts as an inhibitor of the ATPase Ca(2+) pump of the cardiac SR (SERCA2a); inhibition of the pump is relieved upon phosphorylation. The pump removes Ca(2+) from the cytoplasm, thereby preventing cytosolic Ca(2+)-dependent activation of contractile proteins, leading to enhanced muscle relaxation."

PKA-phosphorylation of RyR enhances channel activity by sensitizing the channel to cytosolic calcium. Cytosolic calcium stimulates contractile proteins to promote muscle contraction."

Gi/o inhibits adenylate cyclase to decrease cyclic-AMP (cAMP) levels.
